Component Definitions\n\n#### General Syntax Template:\ncomponent <ComponentName> {\n    port <PortName>() = <ProcessExpression>;\n    ...\n}\n\n#### Semantics\n- A `component` models a computation unit.\n- Each `port` defines the interaction behavior of the component.\n- Ports are associated with roles of connectors via attachments.\n\n#### Example\ncomponent PassengerUI { \n\t port call() = callride->call();\n}\n\ncomponent DriverUI { \n\t port notify() = notified->notify();\n}\n\n#### Explanation:\n- PassengerUI is the passenger’s interface component. Its port call() models the ride-request action, where the event callride represents the passenger initiating a ride. The process callride -> call() means the user can make ride requests.\n- DriverUI is the driver’s interface component. Its port notify() models receiving ride notifications. The event notified represents an incoming alert from the system. The process notified -> notify() means the driver can receive ride notifications.\n\n---\n\n### 3. System Configuration\n\n#### General Syntax Template\nsystem <SystemName> {\n    declare <InstanceName> = <ConnectorType>;\n    attach <Component.Port()> = <Instance.Role()>;\n    ...\n    execute <ProcessComposition>;\n}\n\n#### Semantics\n- The `system` section instantiates connectors, binds components to roles, and defines how the system executes.\n- `execute` combines all processes using CSP operators:\n  - `||` for parallel\n\n\n#### Example\nsystem ridecalling {\n    declare callwire = CSConnector;\n    declare assign = PSConnector;\n    attach PassengerUI.call() = callwire.requester(10);\n\t  attach TripMgmt.accept() = callwire.responder() <*> assignwire.publisher(94);\n\t  attach DriverUI.notify() = assignwire.subscriber();\n    execute PassengerUI.call() || TripMgmt.accept() || DriverUI.notify();\n}\n\n#### Explanation:\n- The call request from PassengerUI.call() flows through callwire from requester to responder, activates TripMgmt.accept(), which, via <*> coupling, triggers assignwire.publisher, leading to assignwire.subscriber and notifying DriverUI.notify().\n- Executes three processes in parallel.\n\n---\n\n## Assertions (Verification Properties) for Wright# specifications\n\n### General Syntax Template\n\nassert <SystemName> |= <LTL_Formula>;\n\n### Semantics\n- Used to formally verify system behavior:\n  - **LTL properties**: Logic formulas specifying desired temporal behavior.\n\n### Liveness Property for behavioral proprerties\n\n### General Syntax Template of Livness property Syntax for Wright# ADL\nassert SystemName |= [] (ComponentName.portName.initial_event -> () ComponentName.portName.target_event);\n\n### Semantics\nIt describe that it is globally true that a initial event will eventually trigger the target event.\n\n#### Examples:\n\nassert ridecalling |= [](PassengerUI.call.callride -> <> DriverUI.notify.notified);\n#### Explanation:\n- Ensures that whenever Passengers call a ride, the Driver can eventually be notified about the ride.\n\nassert fooddelivery |= [](CustomerUI.reportC.report_issue -> <> SupportCenter.handle.investigate);\n#### Explanation:\n- Ensures that whenever CustomerUI reports an issue, the SupportCenter can eventually investigate the issue.\n\n---\n\n## System Misconfiguration: Multiple Attachments to the Same Input Role in Wright# ADL\n###  General Description\nIn Wright# ADL, a connector role defines a point of communication between components. Each input role (e.g., responder, subscriber, readstore) is intended to receive data from exactly one source component port.\nMisconfiguration occurs when the same input role of a connector is attached to more than one component port. This results in non-deterministic system behavior, violating Wright#'s well-formedness rules.\n\n### Why It’s a Problem\nAmbiguity: The system cannot determine which component should handle the data. Non-determinism: Execution traces become unclear or invalid. Tool failure: Formal verification tools like PAT may reject or misinterpret the architecture.\n\n#### Example of Invalid Configuration\n\ndeclare Aconnector = CSConnector;\nattach cp1 = Aconnector.requester(12);\nattach cp2 = Aconnector.responder();\nattach cp3 = Aconnector.responder();\n\n- Problem: Aconnector.responder is an input role. It is attached to both cp2 and cp3. This violates the rule.\n\n#### Corrected Configuration Using a New Connector and Coupling\n- Fix Strategy: Introduce a new connector of the same type. Split the attachments so each input role is uniquely bound. Use the <*> (coupling operator) to define sequential flow.\n\n- Fixed Version\n\ndeclare Aconnector = CSConnector;\ndeclare Bconnector = CSConnector;\nattach cp1 = Aconnector.requester(12) <*> Bconnector.requester(13);\nattach cp2 = Aconnector.responder();\nattach cp3 = Bconnector.responder();\n\n- Resulting Behavior Flow\ncp1 → Aconnector.requester(12) → Aconnector.responder → cp2 → Bconnector.requester(13) → Bconnector.responder → cp3\n\n- This ensuresThe control flow moves sequentially through two connectors. The system is now well-formed and suitable for formal verification.\n\n---\n\nHere are some example software systems in the Wright# Specifications.\n\n1.
