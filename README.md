# LLM-Driven Multi-Agent Software Architecture Refactoring with Integrated Formal Verification

## Overview
This project implements an automated approach to refactor software architecture designs using Large Language Models (LLMs) while ensuring output correctness through formal verification.

## Prerequisites

### Required Tools
1. **Wright# Modules for PAT Verifier**
   - Installation guide: [PAT.ADL Repository](https://github.com/cnacha/PAT.ADL/tree/master)
   - This tool is essential for formal verification of architecture designs

### Python Dependencies
- Python 3.11.9
- Required packages in requirements.txt
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
